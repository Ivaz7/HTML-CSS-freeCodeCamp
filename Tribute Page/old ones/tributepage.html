        <legend>Life and Career</legend>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Early life and the Jackson 5 (1958–1975)</span> - Michael Joseph Jackson was born in
            Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class
            African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther
            Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and
            worked part-time at Sears.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Move to Epic and Off the Wall (1975–1981)</span> - The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975,
            signing with Epic Records and renaming themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band
            around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career. The Jacksons continued to tour
            internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter
            during this time, wrote songs such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" (1978), "This Place Hotel"
            (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1980).</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever (1982–1983)</span> - Jackson recorded
            with Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory"
            and "There Must Be More to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but,
            according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the
            recording studio, and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use. "There Must Be More to Life Than This" was
            released in 2014. Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album
            Victory (1984).</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Pepsi incident, "We Are the World" and other commercial activities (1984–1985)</span> -
            In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that
            broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $15.3 million in 2023). The first Pepsi campaign,
            which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship,
            public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested
            using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its jingle.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Increased tabloid speculation (1986–1987)</span> - Jackson's skin had been medium-brown
            during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage,
            including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin. His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed
            in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He
            also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with
            vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used
            fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of
            color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup,
            he could appear very pale. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his
            vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. He became
            friends with Klein and Klein's assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the
            mother of his first two children.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Bad, autobiography, and Neverland (1987–1990)</span> - Jackson's first album in five
            years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success. It became the
            first album to produce five US number-one singles: "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make
            Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana". Another song, "Smooth Criminal", peaked at number seven.
            Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy Award for Best
            Music Video, Short Form for "Leave Me Alone". Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music
            Awards in 1989 after Bad generated five number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25
            countries and the bestselling album worldwide in 1987 and 1988. By 2012, it had sold between 30 and 45
            million copies worldwide.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Dangerous and public social work (1991–1993)</span> - In March 1991, Jackson renewed
            his contract with Sony for $65 million (equivalent to $145 million in 2023), a record-breaking deal, beating
            Neil Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia Records. In 1991, he released his eighth album, Dangerous,
            co-produced with Teddy Riley. It was certified eight times platinum in the US, and by 2018 had sold 32
            million copies worldwide. In the US, the first single, "Black or White", was the album's highest-charting
            song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances
            worldwide. The second single, "Remember the Time" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles
            chart. At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the bestselling album of the year worldwide and "Black or White"
            the bestselling single of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards. In 1993, he performed "Remember
            the Time" at the Soul Train Music Awards in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals. In
            the UK, "Heal the World" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995)</span> - In August
            1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan
            Chandler. Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. While
            Jordan's mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested him, her position
            wavered a few days later. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used
            to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money. Jackson's older sister La Toya
            accused him of being a pedophile; she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her
            abusive husband.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">HIStory, second marriage, fatherhood and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix
              (1995–1997)</span> - In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future,
            Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits:
            HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions.
            The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US.
            It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold
            worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as
            "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent".</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Label dispute and Invincible (1997–2002)</span> - From October 1997 to September 2001,
            Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, Invincible, which cost $30 million to record, making it the most
            expensive album of all time. In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War Child benefit concert
            in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for
            the children of Guatemala. Later that month, Jackson organized a series of "Michael Jackson & Friends"
            benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men,
            Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano
            Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. In 1999,
            Jackson was presented with the "Outstanding Humanitarian Award" at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City
            where he noted Mahatma Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New
            York City at 4 East 74th Street. At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist
            of the 1980s. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any
            other entertainer.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Documentary, Number Ones, second child abuse allegations and acquittal
              (2002–2005)</span> - Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson
            for several months. The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed
            Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old boy. He said that he saw
            nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which
            aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been
            misunderstood.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Final years, financial problems, Thriller 25 and This Is It (2005–2009)</span> - After
            the trial, Jackson became reclusive. In June 2005, he moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. In
            early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup, Two Seas Records.
            Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy Holmes, later said it was never finalized. Holmes also
            found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits. By September
            2006, Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Death</span> - On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before his concert residency was
            due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol
            and benzodiazepine overdose. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to
            help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22
            pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC) and arrived three minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was
            performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than
            an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were unsuccessful, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm
            Pacific time (21:26 UTC).</li>
